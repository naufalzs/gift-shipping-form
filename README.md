## Gift Shipping Form
The Gift Shipping Form is a personal web app project that implements a multi-step form built using React. I used Sass to write with the BEM methodology for styling, React Hook Form combined with Yup for validation, and Context with the useReducer Hook to manage the state across the app.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
